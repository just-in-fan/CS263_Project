I’m working on a project comparing different AI coding assistants on the same algorithm. Please implement **Dijkstra’s shortest path algorithm** in Python with the following exact API and constraints.

Use this type alias:

    from typing import Dict, List, Tuple
    Node = int
    Weight = float
    Graph = Dict[Node, List[Tuple[Node, Weight]]]

Implement this function:

    def dijkstra(graph: Graph, source: Node) -> Dict[Node, float]:
        """
        Compute the shortest path distance from `source` to every reachable node
        in a directed graph with non-negative edge weights.

        - `graph[u]` is a list of (v, w) edges meaning an edge u -> v with weight w.
        - Return a dict `dist` where `dist[u]` is the distance from `source` to u.
        - Nodes unreachable from `source` should be either:
            - omitted from the result, OR
            - present with distance float("inf"). Pick one convention and document it.
        """

**Requirements:**
- Use a **priority queue (min-heap)** via the Python standard library `heapq` module.
- Overall time complexity should be **O(E log V)** for V nodes and E edges.
- All edge weights are non-negative.
- Implement everything **from scratch**:
  - Do NOT use any external graph library.
  - Do NOT just call an existing shortest-path function.
- Write clean, readable code with a short docstring explaining your behavior for unreachable nodes.

Return only the Python code for the function (and any helpers), no extra commentary.
