"QuickSort is a sorting algorithm based on the Divide and Conquer that picks an 
element as a pivot and partitions the given array around the picked pivot by 
placing the pivot in its correct position in the sorted array" -1

The main idea is to choose an element from the set, move all elements smaller 
than this pivot to the left and move all elements larger than this pivot to the
right. This is done recursively until the elements are sorted.
