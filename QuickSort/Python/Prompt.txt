You are a programming assistant. I am doing an experiment comparing how different coding assistants implement the same algorithm.
Please do the following exactly:

Write Python code only (no explanations, no comments, no markdown).
Define a single function with this exact signature and name:

def quicksort(a: list[int]) -> None:

The function must:
Sort the list in-place in nondecreasing order.

Do not:
Call sorted, list.sort, or any other built-in or library sort.
Import any modules.
Print anything or read input.
Include a main function, tests, timing code, or usage examples.

You may choose any pivot/partition strategy you like, but it must be a genuine quicksort, not another sorting algorithm.

Output only the Python function definition implementing quicksort under these constraints.
