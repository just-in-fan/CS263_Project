You are a programming assistant. I am doing an experiment comparing how different coding assistants implement the same algorithm.
Please do the following exactly:

Write Rust code only (no explanations, no comments, no markdown).
Define a single public function with this exact signature and name:

pub fn quicksort(a: &mut [i32]) {
}

(You should fill in the body.)

The function must:
Sort the slice in-place in nondecreasing order.

Do not:
Call .sort(), .sort_unstable(), or any other library sort.
Use any external crates.
Print anything, read input, or include a main function, tests, or benchmarking code.

You may choose any pivot/partition strategy you like, but it must be a genuine quicksort, not another sorting algorithm.

Output only the Rust function implementation for quicksort under these constraints.
